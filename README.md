# Document Classification

This project is part of assignment home work I got in course I am taking in university.  
The course called: Practical Web Mining and Modeling for Business Applications.

In this assignment we got as input many documents (average of 200 words in document) and the **goal**  is to predict it subject.

The dataset we worked with is "ohsumed-first-20000-docs" which can be downloaded from here: [Link](http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/corpora.htm)  
  
#### Sized of datasets:
Train dataset: 10,433 documents  
Test dataset: 12,733 documents  
We have 23 possible classifications for the documents. The sujects are related to medicine and health.  

I solved this assignment in Python (version 2.7.10)
